## Migration Phases Overview

### ✅ Phase 0: Foundation Setup (COMPLETE)
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md for Swift Embedded architecture
- [x] Create comprehensive logging system
- [x] Document Swift Embedded development environment setup (macOS + Linux)
- [x] Create Swift Embedded demonstration project
- [x] Audit existing components for migration patterns
- [x] Install and test Swift development snapshot (Docker environment)
- [x] Implement ESP32Hardware abstraction layer (GPIO, ADC, PWM, I2C, Timer, WiFi)
- [x] Create SwiftEmbeddedCore component framework
- [x] Verify Swift Embedded compilation pipeline

### 📋 Phase 1: Core Framework (READY TO BEGIN)
- [ ] Enable Swift Embedded flags in Package.swift (remove comment guards)
- [ ] Update SwiftEmbeddedGen to use new architecture
- [ ] Create component factory integration with Swift Embedded
- [ ] Implement YAML → Swift Embedded component generation

### 📋 Phase 2: Network & Protocol Foundation (Planned)
- [ ] Native Swift WiFi management
- [ ] Matter protocol integration
- [ ] Thread networking support

### 📋 Phase 3: Component Migration (Planned)
- [ ] Foundation components (GPIO, ADC, PWM)
- [ ] Communication components (I2C, SPI)
- [ ] Network components (API, OTA)
- [ ] Advanced components (LEDs, complex sensors)

### 📋 Phase 4: Matter Device Ecosystem (Planned)
- [ ] 25+ Matter device types implementation
- [ ] Multi-board support (C3, C6, H2, P4)
- [ ] Alternative protocol support (Zigbee)

### 📋 Phase 5: Production Polish (Planned)
- [ ] Comprehensive hardware testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Complete documentation rewrite

## Current Session Focus

**Immediate Goals**:
1. Complete foundation setup and logging system
2. Set up Swift Embedded development environment
3. Begin auditing existing components

**Key Files Being Modified**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated for Swift Embedded architecture ✅
- `docs/swift-embedded-migration/` - Logging system ✅

**Next Steps**:
1. Create Swift Embedded development environment setup guide
2. Test cross-platform compilation (macOS + Linux)
3. Document current component architecture for migration planning

## Success Criteria

**Phase 0 Complete When**:
- [x] Swift Embedded toolchain working on macOS and Linux
- [x] Comprehensive logging system operational
- [x] Current component audit complete
- [x] Migration roadmap finalized
- [x] Hardware abstraction layer implemented
- [x] Docker development environment ready

**Final Migration Success**:
- Native Swift Embedded compilation throughout
- All components working on actual ESP32 hardware
- DHT sensor working in Swift (tutorial completion)
- Cross-platform development environment
- Complete documentation reflecting Swift Embedded patterns

## Team Handoff Information

**If session disconnects, next agent should**:
1. Read this index file first for complete context
2. Check latest daily log in `01-daily-logs/`
3. Review current phase status and immediate next steps
4. Update logging immediately upon resuming work

**Critical Context**:
- No legacy C++ compatibility required (no existing users)
- Quality and correctness over speed (no timeline pressure)
- Cross-platform Linux support is mandatory
- Hardware testing on actual ESP32 boards required
