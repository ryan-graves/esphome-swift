# Decision 001: Pure Swift Embedded Architecture

**Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Status**: Approved  
**Decision Maker**: User directive + architectural analysis  

## Context

ESPHome Swift was originally designed with a hybrid architecture:
- Swift for development-time parsing and validation
- C++ code generation for ESP32 runtime execution
- Arduino-style libraries for hardware abstraction

This approach created fundamental issues:
- Arduino library dependencies not available in ESP-IDF
- Tutorial blocked by DHT sensor requiring Arduino `DHT.h` library
- Runtime safety limited to C++ capabilities
- Complex bridging between Swift and C++ ecosystems

## Decision

**Migrate completely to pure Swift Embedded architecture**:
- Swift throughout: development time AND runtime execution
- Native Swift hardware abstractions instead of C++ generation
- Direct compilation to ESP32 using Swift Embedded toolchain
- Leverage Apple's official Swift Embedded and Matter support

## Rationale

### Technical Benefits
1. **Runtime Type Safety**: Full Swift type system and memory safety on microcontroller
2. **Unified Development**: Single language from YAML parsing to embedded execution
3. **Modern Language Features**: Closures, optionals, generics, error handling on embedded hardware
4. **Apple Ecosystem**: Official Swift Embedded support, Matter protocol integration
5. **Eliminates Library Issues**: No more Arduino compatibility problems

### Feasibility Assessment (July 2025)
- Swift Embedded officially supports ESP32-C6 (our primary target)
- Apple uses Swift Embedded in production (Secure Enclave Processor)
- Community examples available for ESP32 RISC-V boards
- Cross-platform development toolchain (macOS + Linux)
- Still experimental but production use cases exist

### Strategic Alignment
- No existing users = no legacy compatibility constraints
- Project goal is production-ready ESPHome replacement
- Quality over speed development philosophy
- Long-term sustainability over short-term convenience

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Continue Hybrid Architecture
- **Pros**: Existing work preserved, known challenges
- **Cons**: Arduino library issues persist, limited runtime safety, complex bridging
- **Verdict**: Rejected - doesn't solve fundamental architectural problems

### Option B: Gradual Migration
- **Pros**: Lower risk, incremental progress
- **Cons**: Complexity of maintaining two systems, unclear migration path
- **Verdict**: Rejected - increases complexity without clear benefits

### Option C: Wait for Swift Embedded Maturity
- **Pros**: More stable toolchain later
- **Cons**: Delay in addressing current blockers, uncertain timeline
- **Verdict**: Rejected - current capability sufficient for project needs

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Foundation (Current)
- Update documentation to reflect new architecture
- Set up Swift Embedded development environment
- Create comprehensive migration logging

### Phase 1: Core Framework
- Replace C++ code generation with Swift component assembly
- Implement Swift hardware abstraction layer
- Update build system for Swift Embedded compilation

### Phase 2-5: Component Migration & Polish
- Migrate all components to native Swift
- Implement Matter protocol integration
- Complete testing and documentation

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] Native Swift compilation to ESP32 firmware
- [ ] All components working on actual hardware
- [ ] DHT sensor working natively (resolves tutorial blocker)
- [ ] Cross-platform development environment

### User Experience Success
- [ ] Same YAML configuration format
- [ ] Familiar ESPHome component patterns
- [ ] Improved error messages from Swift type system
- [ ] Better debugging capabilities

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Swift Embedded Stability
- **Mitigation**: Preview toolchain monitoring, fallback planning if needed
- **Status**: Acceptable - Apple production use provides confidence

### Risk: Performance Regression
- **Mitigation**: Benchmark against C++ approach, optimize as needed
- **Status**: Low concern - Swift Embedded designed for constrained environments

### Risk: Ecosystem Gaps
- **Mitigation**: Identify missing libraries early, create compatibility layers
- **Status**: Manageable - core functionality available

### Risk: Development Timeline
- **Mitigation**: No rush policy, quality over speed approach
- **Status**: Not a concern - no existing users to impact

## Review & Updates

This decision will be reviewed after Phase 1 completion to assess:
- Swift Embedded toolchain stability
- Component migration complexity
- Performance characteristics
- Development experience

**Next Review**: After core framework implementation
