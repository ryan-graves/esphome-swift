# Daily Log: July 20, 2025 - Session 2 - Swift Embedded Migration Continuation

**Session ID**: SEM-003  
**Phase**: Phase 0 → Phase 1 Transition  
**Branch**: `feature/swift-embedded-setup`  
**Started**: 15:00 UTC  

## Session Goals
- [x] Assess current migration status
- [x] Create comprehensive todo list for remaining work
- [ ] Complete Phase 0 by installing Swift development snapshot
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 implementation

## Work Completed

### 15:00 - Migration Status Assessment
**Analyzed current state**:
- Phase 0 is ~90% complete (only missing Swift development snapshot)
- Phase 1 is partially complete:
  - ✅ SwiftEmbeddedGen module exists and is implemented
  - ❌ ESP32Hardware module designed but not implemented in main project
  - ✅ Component architecture foundation partially done
- swift-embedded-test directory contains demonstration HAL implementation

**Key findings**:
- The July 21 log shows significant progress not reflected in 00-index.md
- Build system has been converted to Swift Embedded (removing C++ generation)
- Hardware abstraction layer was designed and demonstrated but not integrated

### 15:15 - Swift Development Snapshot Installation
**Attempted to install Swift development snapshot**:
- Current environment has Swift 6.2 (no Embedded support)
- Downloaded swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2025-07-18-a-osx.pkg (1.7GB)
- Created installation script for user to run (requires sudo)

**Installation blocker**: Need user to run `./install-swift-snapshot.sh` with admin privileges

## Next Steps

### Immediate (After Snapshot Installation)
1. Verify Swift Embedded compilation works
2. Test swift-embedded-test project compilation
3. Mark Phase 0 as complete

### Phase 1 Implementation Plan
1. **Create ESP32Hardware module**:
   - Copy HAL implementation from swift-embedded-test
   - Add to Package.swift as proper target
   - Implement: GPIO, Timer, ADC, PWM, I2C, WiFi

2. **Create SwiftEmbeddedCore module**:
   - Component protocol and lifecycle
   - Error types and logging
   - Event loop structure

3. **Update SwiftEmbeddedGen**:
   - Fix dependency paths to use new modules
   - Add ESP32 linker scripts
   - Test end-to-end compilation

## Quality Checkpoints
- [x] Did I rush anything? No - methodically assessed current state
- [x] Is the solution architecturally sound? Yes - following existing migration plan
- [x] Does it work cross-platform? Plan supports macOS/Linux
- [ ] Is it properly tested? Waiting for toolchain installation

## Session Status
**Current blockers**:
- Swift development snapshot installation requires user intervention
- Need to run: `./install-swift-snapshot.sh`

**Ready to continue with**:
- ESP32Hardware module implementation (can start while waiting)
- SwiftEmbeddedCore module creation
- Integration testing once toolchain is ready

**Session Paused**: 15:30 UTC - Waiting for toolchain installation

### 16:00 - Phase 1 Implementation Progress

**While waiting for Swift development snapshot installation**:

#### ESP32Hardware Module Created ✅
- Created Sources/ESP32Hardware/ directory
- Implemented all HAL components:
  - GPIO.swift - Digital I/O control
  - Timer.swift - Hardware timers and delays (fixed deinit keyword issue)
  - ADC.swift - Analog input
  - PWM.swift - LED/motor control (fixed unused variable)
  - I2C.swift - Sensor communication
  - WiFi.swift - Network connectivity
- Added target to Package.swift (with Embedded flags commented out for now)

#### SwiftEmbeddedCore Module Created ✅
- Created Sources/SwiftEmbeddedCore/ directory
- Implemented core components:
  - Component.swift - Base protocols for all components
  - Errors.swift - Error types for Swift Embedded
  - Application.swift - Main application framework with event loop
- Added target to Package.swift

#### SwiftEmbeddedGen Integration Updated ✅
- Updated SwiftPackageGenerator to:
  - Include ESP32Hardware and SwiftEmbeddedCore targets in generated packages
  - Create proper directory structure for HAL modules
  - Copy HAL source files to generated projects
- Fixed dependency relationships
- Added copyHALSources method for HAL distribution

#### Build Verification ✅
- Successfully builds without Swift Embedded flags
- Ready for testing once development snapshot is installed

### 16:30 - Current Status

**Phase 0 Progress**: Still need Swift development snapshot
**Phase 1 Progress**: 
- ✅ ESP32Hardware module implemented
- ✅ SwiftEmbeddedCore module implemented  
- ✅ SwiftEmbeddedGen updated for HAL integration
- ⏳ Waiting for toolchain to test Swift Embedded compilation

**Next Steps**:
1. User needs to run: `./install-swift-snapshot.sh`
2. Re-enable Swift Embedded flags in Package.swift
3. Test compilation with Swift Embedded mode
4. Verify generated packages compile to ESP32 firmware

**Session End**: 16:30 UTC - Major Phase 1 progress completed
